## Why Automate?

> automation versus human effort

- codification of knowledge
- scale
- reduce human error

Note:

You might be able to create a reasonable amount of infrastructure for your applications manually. Clicking around in a cloud console, remoting into servers to install software.  This becomes "tribal knowledge" which can be lost to human memory, staffing changes, or pass on through "oral tradition" as a team grows. We are working with a very real risk this knowledge could be lost.

Your time can be more efficiently spent when you move manual tasks to automation.  Now a smaller team can support more applications. Reducing operation overheard also allows teams to operate independently and choose their own tools - where previously adding to the technology stack would have created a overload of burden on the operations teams.

If we can replay a task - we can replay it in a variety of different environments.  I automate something once and now I can do this in dev, staging and production.  If I attempt the same task manually in 3 environments I'm increasing my chances of missing a step or causing an error.

Resilient systems mean happier staff!
